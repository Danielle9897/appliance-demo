    "Body": "<p>I have a Raspberry pi B, using Debian, just rigged up with a 3.5 inch TFT-LCD monitor via VGA. The text size in command line mode is too small to read, so I would like to increase its size, and one method says \"edit /boot/config.txt\". However the command <code>ls /boot</code> shows no <code>config.txt</code> -- the only <code>.txt</code> file is <code>cmdline.txt</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another method ref: <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/11/cheap-miniature-lcd-screen\">http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/11/cheap-miniature-lcd-screen</a> which says use <code>sudo  dpkg-reconfigure console-setup</code> doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>\n\n<p>Have I done something wrong? I'd appreciate any help in progressing forward from here.</p>\n",

            "Body": "<p>You can use <code>setfont</code> from a terminal to set the current console font to one of the fonts found in <code>/usr/share/consolefonts/</code>. You don't need to specify the full path or the .psf.gz suffix. Just something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>setfont Lat15-Fixed18\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will do the trick. You can play around until you find a font you like, and then to make it systemwide and default, you can specify it in <code>/etc/kbd/config</code> as the kbd package/service takes it upon itself to monkey with the console font during startup.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, you may find the you have to create a custom entry in <code>/etc/fb.modes</code> to get a native resolution on the small screen so the display looks nice and crisp.</p>\n",

            "Body": "<p>Here's the simplest solution: When you log in to Linux (or Unix) a file named <code>.profile</code> is executed by the shell. I recently got a 7\" LCD, 1024x600 monitor. For the last 2 years I've communicated with my Rpi through ssh, but now I needed a system with a small monitor. So I edited the <code>.profile</code> file and added the following line at the end:</p>\n\n<pre><code>setfont /usr/share/consolefonts/Uni3-Terminus28x14.pst.gz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A 14x28 pixel font that works for me. There many (hundreds of) fonts. If you like a bit smaller try 24x12 or bigger 32x16.</p>\n",
