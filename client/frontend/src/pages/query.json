I have SOME experience with raspberry pi, reading questions and answers on here about programing raspberry is how i gained my limited experience. That being considered im just gonna ask from the get go before i buy the hardware how those who are experienced in such things accomplish this, what hardware they would use, and what firmware or whatever it would be they would utilize to do this. This is also the first question ive ever posted to any forum im the walking stereotype of a man not asking directions or looking at instructions.</p>\n",
